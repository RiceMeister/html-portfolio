<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>One of the best world building in all of fiction. The way Oda is able to foreshadow for over a decade ago shows how dedicated he is to his work</p>

<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>AOT has captavated millions and has remained unpredictable at every turn.</p>

<h3>Star Wars Episode 3</h3>
<p>Biasness due to growing up during the prequels but Anikin's fight on Mustafar is one of the bestr fight scenes in film </p>
